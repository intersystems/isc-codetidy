## [Unreleased - 1.1.x]

### Added 
- Automatic tweaks have been reintroduced (after being removed due to breaking issues)
- Pulled in a variety of minor changes from internal development

### Changed
- 

### Fixed
- Bracket matching for automatic tweaks now works
- Configuration method doesn't prompt for an indentation string if automatic indentation is disabled
- Unit tests described in module.xml
- Added unit tests!
- module.xml works with latest package manager version(s) and git-source-control - for some reason, Directory is needed. (This smells like a package manager bug, but the change is backward-compatible.)
